The idea is for plantgenie to help in selecting plants that would be good for someone to get, based on criteria such as 
the climate they can survive in, how quickly or slowly they grow, and how many upvotes they have received in the plantgenie community. 

People can "upvote" a plant in different desirable categories if they think it is good for that category,
and that can help in the selection of plants for other people. 

This is *NOT* complete, and is just a beginning to show coding style particlarly in the PickerUtil.java,
which has a start of some base functionality for plant selection in the plantgenie.
